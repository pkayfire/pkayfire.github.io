<h1 class="text-3xl font-semibold">Peter Kim</h1>

I'm currently exploring web3.

Previously I was a cofounder of <a href="https://sbly.com">SBLY</a>, a holding company of digital brands and audiences that I helped bootstrap profitably to $90M in total revenue.

Before that I briefly worked at Stripe after graduating with a CS degree from UC Berkeley.
